- built with Monogame

# Controls

# Functionality
- Right now the player can be moved around, attack, and throw projectiles.  Enemies move around and those that shoot projectiles
  do so.  Items can be swapped between.  There is no collision detection.

# Known Bugs
- When trying to move link in two directions at once, he stops animating
- Goriya only throws boomerangs upwards for now

# Code Analyzer Suppressions
- CA1812	RedLink is an internal class that is apparently never instantiated. If so, remove the code from the assembly. 
  If this class is intended to contain only static members, make it static (Shared in Visual Basic).

  Suppressed because we expect to intantiate red link later on in the project.
