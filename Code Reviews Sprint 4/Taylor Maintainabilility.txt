I believe that this class has good maintainability.  The main reason for this is because it extends an
abstract class which implements most of the functionality needed for the wallmaster states.  All this class 
needs to do then is simply override the update method.  This class is also maintainable because it doesn't
rely on too many types and for the types that it does rely on, if the behavior of those types was wanted to
be changed that would not have to happen in this class, it would have to happen in the other classes.
