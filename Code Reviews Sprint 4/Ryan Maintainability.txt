This class executes good maintainability as the bomb and the explosion that the bomb creates are seperate. This means
that if something needed to be changed about the bomb but not the explosions then the explosion class wouldn't need to be changed. 
This also will help resolve any errors as it can effectively be found if the error originates in the explosion or the bomb
itself, meaning there is 1/2 the code to comb through when error checking.
