The level of coupling in the class seems pretty high.
It knows about six different classes, one of which is the game class.
Interfaces are not used. If one of the HUD classes got replaced by a
new HUD class, this class would have to change both the initialization code
and the field type that had been using that class. Basically, slightly more work
for a simple change.
