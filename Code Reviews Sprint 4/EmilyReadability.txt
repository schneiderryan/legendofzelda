Overall I would that this class is very readable, I understand that 
this is the game's transition from link dying back to a new game. 
All variables and methods have descriptive names.
The only issue I see with readability is the use of magic numbers for the tintTimer,
this is because I don't really understand why these numbers were chosen. However,
this is ok given that these numbers were probaly used to recreate the timing in 
the orginal zelda game. If needed or wanted could move these values to a ulitiy class.
