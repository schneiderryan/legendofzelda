LoseState.cs

Overall, I would say that this code would be easy to maintain. It is a pretty short class
with only around 100 lines and each method is 5 lines or less. Variables used in this class
are private as well which is good code practice. Also the class has high cohesion as this
class focuses only on the losing state of the game and not all the states of the game.
It also has loose coupling as the class only calls methods to get and change other classes
variables. Finally it has not high coupling because the class only depends on LegendOfZelda,
IGameState and Textures directly.

A hypothetical change to make to the game would be to have different save points 
in the game so that if you died you would reset to that location. I think this is a
realistic hypothetical change. The current implementation could not easily support this change
as it would require adding more classes most likely. The easiest way I think to do this would to make
game states for each save point and also more lose states for each of those save points.
