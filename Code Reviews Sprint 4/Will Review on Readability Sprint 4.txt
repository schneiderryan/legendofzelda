Overall, I'd say this class is quite readable, especially given the logic this class has to deal with. 
The door switching logic is pretty complicated, but how the variables are named makes it easier to 
follow along since the names align very easily with the actions or functions of the variable. This
class on the whole does a good job remaining readable with branching logic.
