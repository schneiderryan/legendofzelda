Sprint 4 Reflection (HyperLinks to the Past):
Overall, while we may have had some struggles throughout, our team did a good job powering through
any issues we ran into during this sprint. This sprint especially has been a crazy time in the world
in general and of course was just as wild for us as students. However, we were all able to find the
time and motivation to keep working throughout the process and stay relatively on track. However,
our team did have some communication issues, especially earlier in the sprint, but these issues had 
faded away towards the end of the sprint and things really came together well when we needed it to.
Overall, we did a good job this sprint but, yet again, there is plenty of room for improvement
and we will need to improve as the next sprint is more free form when compared to other sprints,
which will require us to communicate effectively to succeed.
