The Class performs the task of placing a bomb on the ground to be exploded. The class does a great job at seperating the
bomb into different tasks so that it can be effiently blown up and resposibility is passed on as to not make the class too
large. The names of the variables are informative and fully explain what is doing what. Great Readability, 10/10
