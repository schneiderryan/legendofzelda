I would say that Adam's class has good maintability. The collisions in particular should be very
maintanable as well as the code for unlocking the doors. This class is also not overly long, which
adds to its maintainability further. One hypothetical change to the game could be if we had to work
on the overworld, which has multiple doors on each edge of the screen, this could cause some issues
but I think the class or the way the class is called could be modified relatively easily to 
deal with these changes.
