The Class performs a the basic task of switching from the play state to a paused state, with the ability to add additional
state changes if the game is further developed because it implements the IGameState interface (which we are familar with from other game state classes). The only issue I see with readability
is the remaining Magic Numbers used to draw the HUD+background, but the team is planning on creating a class to handle these and provide variables in their place. This class has great readability.
