PauseGameCommand.cs

10 minutes

This class has good maintainability because it implements the ICommand interface which provides functionality for commands to be executed.
It simply uses a boolean in order to change back into the correct state and is executed by another (SinglePressKeysController) controller. 
If another game state were to require a pause state, you could easily add logic to the existing code by addding another instance variable and if/else statements.
