Using keys to check if link is attacking seems a bit weird.
Other than that, the class is pretty simple ans should be easy
to maintain on its own.
	However, if there was a bug in the link class, the other player
classes would probably have the same problem. You'd have to change
all of them to fix it. Same if you wanted to add something. If the
player classes used an abstract class or something similar, it'd be
easier to maintain.
