Comments:
All in all, I'd say code quality is very good. Method size kept to a minimum, class is not very cluttered at all. Anything that can be
abstracted to other methods when able, which I think should make the code easily maintainable. However, the update
method does contain a lot of logic, but this seems unavoidable to me since the bomb has multiple states with wildly
different behaviors, plus dealing with the fuse count down. One hypothetical change that could be made to the game is if
there was a feature where the player could hold onto and cook a bomb before placing it, and the current implementation may
not support this but could easily be changed to include this feature with a bombtimer variable or something similar, 
especially since most of the class is abstracted to other methods so changing this class to accommodate new features
would not be particularly difficult.
