Sprint 2 Reflection (HyperLinks to the Past):
Overall, we believe our group did a relatively good job on this sprint staying organized and on task as well as communicating with each 
other in regards to what work we still had to complete. We could have done a better job splitting up the tasks into more manageable 
subtasks so the workload would be more evenly distributed, but going into the sprint we weren't really sure how long these tasks would 
take and how difficult they might be, so next time we believe we will do a better job with this. Additionally, we could have done a better 
job being specific with the subtasks so each person knows exactly what they are doing if there is some overlap between tasks. We do plan 
on doing a few things differently next sprint such as spending more time at the beginning of the sprint organizing the tasks that need
to be completed and deciding who needs to complete those tasks. In addition, Will had a ton of problems with his Github and Visual Studio
not running the projects, but he will be going to the office hours of the grader this week to try to sort out these issues, so hopefully
that will be different next sprint. Overall, we believe we are off to a good start and will learn from any project management mistakes we
may have made this sprint and will improve as a team as the project goes along.
