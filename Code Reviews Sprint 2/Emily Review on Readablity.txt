    Overall, I think Will's code is pretty readable. The variable and methods names helped me follow along 
with what their purpose is for the most part, having the controller called random confused me for a moment. 
The constructor makes sense as well, it is setting all the properties of the enemy. Most of the method
functionality is absracted to the enemy's state or in the case of draw it's sprite. the Update function is
slightly more complex as the changing of the direction is dealt with inside the method directly, but it is
still very easy to understand what the methods are doing.
