Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Overall I think the readabilty of your MovingDownLinkState class is pretty solid. The only confusion I have with naming
conventions is the difference between Moving and Walking (which you use in the sprite factory). Are there other speeds
of movement or should moving be changed to walking/vice versa? Other than that I think the class is very readable, nothing is confusing 
as to what it's referring to.
