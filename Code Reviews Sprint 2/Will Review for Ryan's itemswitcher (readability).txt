Overall, I think Ryan's code is very readable and I had no trouble following along with what Ryan's code was actually
doing. The constructor is no longer than it needs to be, and the variable names are very appropriate considering their
functions, which makes the code much easier to read and understand. The execute command contains most of the logic, 
but this method is easy to read as it leans heavily on using the game object, which means all the variables used 
have names perfectly suited for easy readability, such as ItemsIndex. In the end, I had no problems at all reading
and understanding Ryan's class.
