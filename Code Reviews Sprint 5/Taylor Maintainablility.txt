This class has very good maintainablility.  In the event that more game modes where added, only one line of 
code in the entire class would have to change.  Everything else would work properly without any changes being
made.  The only thing that would need to be changed if the game modes were changed is the array of game mode
strings that is used to determine what mode is currently selected.  Even this could perhaps be removed by 
passing an array of what game modes are possible into the commands constructor.  This would be a very small 
change however and as this class currently is the maintainablility is excellent.
