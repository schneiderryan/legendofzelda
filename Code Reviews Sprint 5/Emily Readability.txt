MusicLoop.cs

I would say that this code is very readable, I can easily see that the 
purpose of this file is to loop through music. All variables and 
methods have descriptive names. The only issue I see with readability is
the use of magic floating for list of songs,  this is because I don't 
really understand why these numbers were chosen. However, this is ok 
given that these numbers were probably used to recreate the feeling in 
the original zelda game. If wanted could move these values to a 
utility class.
