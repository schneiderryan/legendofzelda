Sprint 5 Reflection (HyperLinks to the Past):
Overall, this sprint went relatively smoothly for our team. This sprint was and felt significantly
shorter than the other sprints, but this did not seem to affect us too much. We got out to a good 
start and kept adding features as we went along. Everyone seemed very busy due to all the finals
and projects we all have for other classes but we were able to find time and make something we 
are proud of. This is the final sprint for the semester, so we now finally get to look back and
see how the game came along as well as how it ended up. In the end, we are very proud of the progress
we made and the finished product of the game we created.
