SelectModeCommand.cs

I believe that this class has good overall readablility.  It may take a minute of looking it over to fully
understand exactly what is happening but once you do, this class is easy to understand.  Once you look over
the code you can see that the execute command is broken into 2 parts, the first is determining which game
mode is currently selected (which mode the selection "box" is on) and the second part is moving the selection
box up or down to the next game mode.  Thus, in my opinion the readablility of this class is good.
