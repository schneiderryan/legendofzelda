I would say that Taylor's class has good maintability. This class has low coupling, since it does not
use information from other modules unless it has to, which it does in the case of the player.
This class is also not overly long, whichadds to its maintainability. One hypothetical change to the 
game could be if the Cone of Vision was forced to change size around Link in certain spots, such
as maybe if a certain room is darker so the Cone becomes smaller. However, I think this implementation
could support this relatively easily by just changing the size of the xOffset or yOffset after 
checking that the player is in a certain room or area.
