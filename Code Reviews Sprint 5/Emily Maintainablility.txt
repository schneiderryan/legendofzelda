MusicLoop.cs

Overall, I would say that this code would be easy to maintain. It is a 
pretty short class with only around 50 lines and each method is 5 lines 
or less. Also the class has high cohesion as this class focuses only on 
looping through 3 different sounds. It also has loose coupling as the 
class only calls methods to get and change other classes variables. 
Finally it has not high coupling because the class only depends on Sounds,
And MediaPlayer.

A hypothetical change to make to the game would be to have different songs
for different game modes that are used like dark mode having more creepy
music. I think this is a realistic hypothetical change. The current 
implementation could support this change but it would require passing 
Musicloop the game mode.
