The class is very short and simple, which is good for maintainability.
All the state changing methods have a small degree of code duplication
with both eachother and the other state classes. If one thing about
state changing needs to be changed, it would have to be changed in multiple
methods in multiple files. 
If the state changing logic, like setting the sprite, was in the constructor
for each of the state classes instead, potential changes would be more manageable.
