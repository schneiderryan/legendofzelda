There's commented-out code in the constructor, kinda messy.
'starttimer' is never used.
Update is long.
The chase methods are public, but they're only used inside the class.
If the magic numbers are based on the room layout, then if the room layout changes,
the traps will break.
If traps became killable, code would have to be changed in both the trap class and
the collision classes.
