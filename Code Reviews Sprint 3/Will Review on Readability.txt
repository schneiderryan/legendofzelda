This class did take a little time to read through, but that is a result of how long it is rather than it being particularly
difficult to read. The names of all variables such as lists of possible items, enemies, doors, etc. make sense and make
the code generally easy to follow. The methods do have a lot to do, so at first it can seem daunting to read the class, but
once you start going through everything makes perfect sense. Thankfully this class is readable because whenever I have had
to create and add a new NPC or Enemy to our game, this class makes it relatively easy and simple, which I think reflects very 
well on the readability of the class.
