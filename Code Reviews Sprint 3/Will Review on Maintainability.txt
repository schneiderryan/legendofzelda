LevelLoader.cs

Comments: Overall, I think this class is very maintainable. The class is long, but that makes sense because it contains almost
all of the code and logic for level setup, which is a lot to cover. However, the class is as concise as it can be given the circumstances,
and is very easy to edit in order to add new parts to the game. For example, adding a new Enemy type is very straightforward, you simply
need to add that enemy to the list of possible enemies as well as a check for that enemy in the LoadEnemies() method, but as I said, this 
is a pretty simple process, which makes adding new enemies and features such as different types of items, doors, etc. to the game
much easier. One hypothetical change to the game would be a new type of wall or block, such as if we begin to work on the outer world
of the game, but theoretically it should not be too difficult to create a new type of block with a different texture and add that to 
possibleBlocks or possibleDoors depending on the behavior. For example, in the outside environments there actually aren't doors,
there is just open space for the player to walk through, but I think this class could be modified relatively easily to deal with this change.
