Sprint 3 Reflection (HyperLinks to the Past):
Overall, our team again did a pretty good job organizing ourselves this sprint, but there is definitely still room for improvement.
Our communication as a team could have been better, as there have been times where multiple people have been working on a similar 
aspect of the project but maybe in different spots or in different ways, which has caused some problems with merging and causing bugs
that didn't exist before. However, we were able to work through these bugs and combine the parts into a whole. Additionally, creating the 
burndown chart has been more problematic than expected, but we figured out a way to make it work. We did do a significantly
better job this sprint making more specific subtasks within the larger overall tasks so it was clear what needed to be completed
before the next sprint. In the end, we believe that we improved in our team management this sprint compared to last sprint but still 
have room to grow as a team as the project continues.
