Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

Everything in the ItemCollision is extremely readable. There's not a whole lot of functionality listed in the class but it provides
crucial functionality for using items. It follows the same format as the other Collision classes and is called from CollisionHandler. cs
in an equivalant way.
