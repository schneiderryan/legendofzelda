Overall, code quality is very good.  In all methods except draw, actions are abstracted out into other methods so that the code
is simple and doesn't contain too much functionality within this single class, making this code very reusable.  The only method
that isn't abstracted is the draw method.  If the behavior of drawing a damaged link were changed, then the draw method would
have to heavily be changed in order to support the change.  If the draw method were more abstracted, less work would need to be
done in order to fix the method.  Other than that though, I feel that the rest of the code is very well abstracted so it is very
reusable in the case that other changes were to be made.
