Overall, code quality is very good.  Many of the methods simply call another abstracted method so that all of the logic is not
contained in this single class.  This means that if changes to those behavior were necessary, the code in the aquamentus class
itself would not have to change in those methods.  Looking at the code overall, I think that the maintainablility of the class
is very good.  If the aquamentus were to start at a position other than the middle of the window then some changes would have to 
be made but this is a very simple change where position could simply be passed in the constructor of the aquamentus.  Other than 
that, I don't see anything that would be hard to maintain if other changes were to be made.
