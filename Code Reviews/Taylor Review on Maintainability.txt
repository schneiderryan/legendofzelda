Overall, the code quality is very good.  Many of the methods simply call another abstracted method so that all of the logic is not
contained in this single class.  This means that if changes to those behavior were necessary, the code in the damaged link class
itself would not have to change in those methods.  Looking at the code overall, I think that the maintainablility of the class
is very good.  The only thing that may be a little difficult to maintain could be the draw method if the way that damaged link 
is drawn were to change but other than that this classes maintainablility seems very good to me.
