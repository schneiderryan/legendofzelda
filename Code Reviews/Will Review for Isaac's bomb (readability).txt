Sprint #2
Name of .cs file being reviewed: Bomb.cs
Author of .cs file being reviewed: Isaac Smith
Number of Minutes: 7
Overall, I'd say the readability of Isaac's bomb class is very solid. Variables have names that are accurate to their function, makes code very 
easy to understand. Method size kept to a minimum, class is not very cluttered at all, which makes reading through
the code much easier. Additionally, method names are accurate to their purpose similarly to the variable names, which adds
to the ease of understanding what the code is doing when, for example, the fuse delay is counting down until the bomb
finally detonates. I did struggle for maybe a few seconds to see what was happening in the draw method, but I was 
quickly able to put together that this logic is for if the bomb has been used, which means it is finished detonating,
then it is no longer needed to be drawn by the spritebatch.
