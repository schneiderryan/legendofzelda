Overall, everything is very readable.  Things are named so that it is easy to understand what they are and what they're behavior
should be.  Methods bodies are for the most part very short and easy to understand.  The only method that is longer is the method
for draw, but it is necessary for this method to be a little longer in order to get the behavior that is desired.  Even with this
method being longer, things are still named well and it is easy to quickly get an idea of what is happening within the method.
