Comments:
	Overall, I would say Will's code quality is high. The cohesion is high has the class
	only deals with the Stalfo enemy and doesn't have all the details of function. However the
	coupling could be looser, because the class depends on RandomEnemyController which could be
	moved out of this class. The class does have loose coupling as the class doesn't have many
	details on other class' fields. In addition, the class as a whole is short as well as all 
	methods in the class. As stated in the readiability review the class has well throught out
	method and variables names. The only other consideration is that the constructor sets xPos
	and yPos are set to 400 and 200 and randomStep.Next(0,150). I don't think there is a good way
	to fix this that would help with the addition sprints.

Hypothetical Change:
	A hypothetical change that could be made would be for multiple Stalfo enemy to appear on 
	a level in different starting positions. The current implementation would be able to
	support this functionality but it would require some changes. this could be done
	by passing in xPos and Ypos through the constructor.
