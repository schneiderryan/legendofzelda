Comments:
Overall, I think Ryan's code is up to good code quality standards. This is a command, so that means other classes abstract
their methods to this class. This means the execute command does contain a good amount of logic, but the logic is very
simple and easy to understand, which should make it easy to reuse as it serves a very simple purpose, to switch
between a list of items that Link possesses. The class also has to deal with wraparound, when the index is at 0 and 
the previous weapon is commanded to be shown, so the class must start back at the end of the list to find the previous
item, and vice versa when talking about commanding next while on the last item in the list. A hypothetical change that
could be made to the game would be the ability to switch to a specific item or weapon instantly instead of having to cycle
through the entire lsit to find the item that the player is looking for. The current implementation would not be able to
support that functionality at this moment, but I think it could easily be modified to take a number as a parameter and
use that number to find the proper itemIndex of the item we are looking for.
