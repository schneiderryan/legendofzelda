The time it took to do this: 8min

The properites refering to single letter variables isn't particaully readable.
The item timer isn't used in the UseItem method, but is used in the UseProjectile
method, seem a bit odd. Naming the itemTimer soming like attackCooldown
would amke more sense.
The rest of the class is nice and readable, with lots of short methods.
