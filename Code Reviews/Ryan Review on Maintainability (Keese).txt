Overall, the code looks maintainable. The class is fairly basic and all of the moving motions
call states that can be used by any class. I think it is good that when making a Keese we have a unique
class for them rather than making a generic Enemy class that can be any enemy. That way they can be
customized to need and bugs can be contained within each individual enemy. Code is even kept
under 100 lines while spacing it out to make it more readable.
